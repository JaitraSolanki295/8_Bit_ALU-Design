# 8_Bit_ALU-Design
Designed an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using SCL 180nm CMOS technology, performing addition and subtraction operations based on a ripple carry adder architecture.
Verified the design using Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) to ensure correctness.
Post-layout simulation was performed to validate functionality and timing after layout extraction.
